# Convolutional Neural Network

Trained model on 100x100 sized RGB images data set using TensorFlow.

Explored various hyper parameters such as:
      Number of Kernels and Kernel Size in convolution layer

      Number of Neurons in hidden layer

      Number of Epochs

      Optimizer: Adam and SGD

      Learning Rate in SGD

      Number of  CNN Layers and Hidden Layers
